<br>
<br>

- **Any programming language** with vector operations, preferably Python or Matlab. But Java can also do (however, you will miss the vector operations, unless you use a library such as jama). Python (see also other references)
#### Python
  - [Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) - Programming with Mosh (YouTube)
  - [Python Tutorial - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) - Programming with Mosh (YouTube)
  - [Python Courses](https://python-course.eu/) - python-course.eu

#### Matlab
  - [Matlab Academy](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/)

### (**Optional**)
Some knowledge of data structures basic (Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues ) and advanced (Disjoint Sets, Self-Balancing Trees, Segment Trees, Tries, quadtree...).<br>
These are needed to understand implementation of meta-heuristic algorithms.
